# Exploratory Data Analysis on GitHub Ticket Issues

This repository contains the code for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of GitHub ticket issues. The analysis aims to explore the dataset, identify patterns, and derive insights from the data.

## Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes 15,955 rows and 132 columns covering ticket details, reactions, labels, assignees, milestones, etc.
- **Key Steps**:
  - **Loading the Data**: Data loaded using `pandas`.
  - **Initial Exploration**: Identified shape, column details, and handled missing values.
  - **Reactions Analysis**: Analyzed reactions, finding the maximum and minimum values.
  - **Datetime Conversion**: Converted relevant date columns from strings to datetime format.

The EDA process reveals insights into the distribution of reactions, missing data patterns, and timestamp details in GitHub ticket issues.
